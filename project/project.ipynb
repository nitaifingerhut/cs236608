    "Recommending items from a fixed-size set of items to a fixed-szie set of users is an open challenge for the followiung reasons (partial list): \n",
    "1) i.i.d principle violation:\\\n",
    "One of the basic assumptions in training a 'classic' predictive model is independence & identically distribution of the training data.\\\n",
    "As a consequnce, one assumes that all data points presented to the model during training are drawn from a time-invariant distribution function.\\\n",
    "But in Rec Systems, this is not hold. The users change their behaviors (their underlyning distributions) as a response to the recommender decisions.\\\n",
    "This forces the recommender to be strategic in the face of uncertainity, which is quite difficult during training, when the recommender is yet uncapable in term of predictive performance. \n",
    "2) Even regardless to the feedback loop between the recommender & the users, still the user model changes frequently over time during training.\\\n",
    "Since the recommender model (at least the vanilla version) does not have a ense of time, it is hardly capable learning the prefernces changing function, even when it is user-invariant, time-invariant and changes slow enough. \n",
    "3) We hypothesize that if a model would be capable to learn the users underlying change function, it could use this information for better predictions, which in turn would lead to better recommendations.\n",
    "4) We examined various recommender models that were trained on a tensor of obeserved ratings over last k iterations rather than a single frameshot ratings matrix in the vanilla AutoRec version.\n",
    "5) Furthermore, wed hypothesized that if we will feed the model with its previous decisions (another temporal window of recommendations), it will be able to mitigate the phanomena presented in 1).\n",
    "TL;DR it didn't work though. "
